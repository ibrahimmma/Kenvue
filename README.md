## Project Overview

This project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at dissecting and understanding complex data patterns to facilitate informed decision-making. Our methodology unfolds in a structured manner, beginning with the meticulous preparation and cleansing of our dataset to eliminate any discrepancies that might hinder our analytical accuracy. We then pivot to a strategic analysis, focusing on a selected array of critical needs based on preliminary findings and progress. The goal is to achieve a holistic understanding by incorporating insights from both seasonality and all-season products. The culmination of our effort is to project future sales trends employing a suite of forecasting methods, including moving averages, trend analysis, and seasonal indexing, to refine our predictive accuracy.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to unlock actionable insights from the data at our disposal. By employing a comprehensive suite of analytical techniques, we aim to identify underlying patterns, trends, and seasonal fluctuations that could inform future sales strategies. Our ambition is to not only interpret the data but to forecast future trends with a high degree of accuracy, enabling strategic decision-making.

## Team Composition and Responsibilities

- xxxx - Head of Data Preparation and Cleansing
- xxxx - Head of Analytical Modeling
- xxxx - Head of Forecasting and Predictive Analysis

## Data Preparation Strategy

Our approach to data cleaning is methodical, focusing on restructuring the dataset for optimal analysis. This involves transforming need states into individual columns and reorganizing fiscal years and weeks into distinct, singular columns. The benchmark for our cleaning process is the "Total Sales - UTSC lecture.csv" file, which serves as a model for filtering and refinement.

## Tools and Technologies

To navigate through the intricacies of data analysis and forecasting, we leverage a robust toolkit comprising:

- **Software and Libraries**: Python, with key libraries including `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Numpy` for numerical computation, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization, `StatsModel` for statistical modeling, and `Scikit-learn` for machine learning.
- **Analytical Tools**: ChatGPT for AI-driven insights, `Power BI`, and potentially `Tableau` for data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **Techniques**: Forecasting methodologies inspired by operations management principles, focusing on moving averages, trend analysis, and seasonal indexing.

## External References

Our analysis is enriched with external data and insights, details of which will be outlined in this section (to be updated as the project progresses).

## Conclusion

Embarking on this project, we are driven by a quest for knowledge and an ambition to distill complex data into actionable insights. Through diligent analysis and innovative forecasting, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that will empower decision-making and strategic planning.
