## Project Overview

This project is an ambitious endeavor aimed at dissecting and understanding complex data patterns to facilitate informed decision-making. Our methodology unfolds in a structured manner, beginning with the meticulous preparation and cleansing of our dataset to eliminate any discrepancies that might hinder our analytical accuracy. We then pivot to a strategic analysis, focusing on a selected array of critical needs based on preliminary findings and progress. The goal is to achieve a holistic understanding by incorporating insights from both seasonality and all-season products. The culmination of our effort is to project future sales trends employing a suite of forecasting methods, including moving averages, trend analysis, and seasonal indexing, to refine our predictive accuracy.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to unlock actionable insights from the data at our disposal. By employing a comprehensive suite of analytical techniques, we aim to identify underlying patterns, trends, and seasonal fluctuations that could inform future sales strategies. Our ambition is to not only interpret the data but to forecast future trends with a high degree of accuracy, enabling strategic decision-making.

## Team Composition and Responsibilities

- **Omar Khalid** - *Head of Strategy*
  - Responsible for devising and implementing overarching business strategies to guide the direction of the project. This role involves analyzing market trends, identifying opportunities for growth, and setting long-term goals.
- **Saad Najam** - *Head of Analytical Modeling*
  - Focuses on constructing and refining predictive models and analytical frameworks to support data-driven decision-making. This involves running models using `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`, among other tools, to analyze complex datasets and extract meaningful insights.
- **Ibrahim Yibulayin** - *Head of Forecasting and Predictive Analysis*
  - Specializes in predicting future sales and market trends based on historical data analysis. This role involves using advanced forecasting techniques to project sales for upcoming periods and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights to the Head of Strategy.

## Data Preparation Strategy

Our approach to data cleaning is methodical, focusing on restructuring the dataset for optimal analysis. This involves transforming need states into individual columns and reorganizing fiscal years and weeks into distinct, singular columns. The benchmark for our cleaning process is the `Total Sales - UTSC lecture.csv` file, which serves as a model for filtering and refinement.

## Tools and Technologies

To navigate through the intricacies of data analysis and forecasting, we leverage a robust toolkit comprising:

- **Software and Libraries**: Python, with key libraries including `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Numpy` for numerical computation, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization, `StatsModel` for statistical modeling, and `Scikit-learn` for machine learning.
- **Analytical Tools**: ChatGPT for AI-driven insights, `Power BI`, and potentially `Tableau` for data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **Techniques**: Forecasting methodologies inspired by operations management principles, focusing on moving averages, trend analysis, and seasonal indexing.

## External References

Our analysis is enriched with external data and insights, details of which will be outlined in this section (to be updated as the project progresses).

## Conclusion

Embarking on this project, we are driven by a quest for knowledge and an ambition to distill complex data into actionable insights. Through diligent analysis and innovative forecasting, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that will empower decision-making and strategic planning.
