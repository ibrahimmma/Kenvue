## Project Overview for Kenvue

This project is dedicated to Kenvue, aiming to harness the potential of advanced analytics to navigate through the complexities of sales data. By focusing on Kenvue's diverse product portfolio, characterized by both seasonal demand fluctuations and stable demand products, our mission is to optimize Kenvue's supply chain efficiency and enhance sales channel effectiveness. Our approach commences with a rigorous phase of data cleaning and preparation, setting the stage for a deep dive into the analytics that will inform strategic decisions.

## Objectives

Our objectives are tailored to Kenvue's strategic needs:
- To delineate the effectiveness of sales through traditional retail versus e-commerce channels.
- To explore how seasonality impacts product sales and identify patterns.
- To devise supply chain optimization strategies aimed at reducing overstock scenarios, thereby aligning Kenvue's inventory levels with market demand.

## Team Composition and Responsibilities

- X - Head of Strategy: Orchestrates the project's direction, ensuring the alignment of analytics with Kenvue's strategic goals.
- X - Head of Analytical Modeling: Leads the charge in dissecting data through sophisticated analytical models to uncover underlying patterns.
- X - Head of Forecasting and Predictive Analytics: Focuses on leveraging historical data to forecast future demands, guiding supply chain adjustments.

## Data Preparation Strategy

To ensure a solid foundation for analysis, our strategy emphasizes:
- Streamlining the dataset by organizing need states into distinct columns.
- Simplifying the temporal data representation by consolidating fiscal years and weeks.
- Adhering to "Total Sales - UTSC lecture.csv" as the gold standard for our data cleaning process.

## External Data and References

To augment our analysis for Kenvue, we will incorporate:
- Demographic insights and industry trends from resources such as IBIS and Simply Analytics.
- This additional context will enrich our understanding and bolster the robustness of our recommendations.

## Technologies and Techniques

The project leverages cutting-edge tools and methodologies:
- **Languages and Libraries**: Utilizing Python and its powerful libraries (`Pandas`, `Numpy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `StatsModel`, `Scikit-learn`) for data analysis and modeling.
- **Analytical Tools**: Integrating insights from ChatGPT, with `Power BI` and potentially `Tableau` for visualizing data in a compelling and informative manner.
- **Forecasting Techniques**: Applying proven forecasting methods from operations management to predict and plan for future sales trends and seasonality effects.
